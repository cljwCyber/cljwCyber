Hello, I'm Chris, and these are my CyberSecurity first steps!
I hope to use this as a log, and progress tracker, of my venture into the world of CyberSecurity. I come into this with only a very passive knowledge of how networks, hardware and computers work generally. My aim is to boost that knowledge significantly and put me in a position to become hireable as a Security Operations Centre (SOC) Analyst in the future.

I am currently a chartered CIMA Accountant with over 10 years of management experience including negating risk, governance and problem solving. It hopefully goes without saying that a career in Finance / Accounting means you need a keen eye for details and to be able to explain things to professionals that perhaps have no knowledge in your area of expertise. I'm hoping these skills will be transferable into CyberSecurity.

As-of Jan'26, I am working through TryHackMe's Intro to CyberSecurity modules and my aim is to look at some certifications once that is under my belt.
