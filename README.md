Hello, I'm Chris, and these are my first steps into CyberSecurity!

I hope to use this as a log, and progress tracker, of my venture into the world of CyberSecurity. 

I am currently a chartered CIMA Accountant with over 10 years of management experience including risk management, governance assessment and implementation and problem solving. I believe that in Finance you need a keen eye for detail and to be able to react quickly and think on your feet - skills I believe will transfer well into CyberSecurity. I'm very much looking forward to bringing my experience into a Cyber role.

I come into this with only a very passive knowledge of how networks, hardware and computers work generally, but I am working to upskill in these areas first and put myself in a position to become hireable as a Security Operations Centre (SOC) Analyst in the future.

As-of Jan'26, I am working through TryHackMe's Intro to CyberSecurity modules and my aim is to look at some certifications once that is under my belt.
